							<h1>Frederick Pringle</h1>
							<p class="major">I am a passionate, hard-working, self-taught programmer and technology enthusiast, with a Master's degree in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics from the University of Oxford. I try to bring focus, dedication and intelligence to everything I do. Currently employed as a scientific researcher, I am looking for opportunities in the technology, software, research and related industries. I am skilled in several programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Haskell and Javascript; and have some experience in Ruby, TypeScript, and Rust. I believe I can be a valuable addition to any development or research team, and look forward to any opportunity to expand my skillset.</p>
							<p class="major">Below you can find some samples of coding projects I have worked on in my free time, organised by language. You can also jump to the <a href="#aboutme">About Me</a> section or <a href="#contact">send me a message</a>.</p>

                                        <p>Most of my professional experience is in C++. It's what I use at work on a day-to-day basis, and is one of the languages I feel most comfortable in.</p>

							<h2>Cybotify</h2>
                            <p>Cybotify is an ongoing project with the goal of increasing my proficiency in database management, machine learning, API development, and website design. The website uses Spotify's public "audio features" API to analyze user's playlists, categorising them according to themes such as accousticness, energy, key and tempo. In the future, the end goal of the project is to use machine learning to identify poorly-organised playlists, suggest alternate grouping of songs into playlist, and recommend new songs for playlists.</p>

                            <p>New competencies I learned from this project:</p>

                            <h3>API development</h3>
                            <p>The backend of the website uses Django for handling HTTP requests, authentication, and connecting to the Spotify API. Having never designed this kind of website before, I had to learn a lot about API design, HTTP routes and JSON encoding/decoding.</p>

                            <h3>Relational databases</h3>
                            <p>I used Django's built-in DBMS to manage user information, playlists, and track features, using PostgreSQL for the database backend. I gained a lot of knowledge of relational databses and query languages like SQL.</p>

                            <h3>Multi-dimensional data visualisation</h3>
                            <p>This project presented the challenge of explaining complicated multi-dimensional analysis to the user in an easily-digestable way. To visualise the feature analysis of user tracks and playlists, after some research I decided to use a "Spider plot" using PlotlyJS.</p>

							<h2>Strawberry</h2>
							<p>Strawberry is a Chess engine and GUI written in C++. I think writing a Chess engine is a great way to improve mastery of a language, and C++ is the ideal high-performance language for the computation required for decent move search, while providing fine-grained memory management for caching results.</p>

                            <p>Once I was happy with the core engine, I added a GUI to make the engine user-friendly. This was written in QT 5. I then added support for Strawberry to communicate via the Universal Chess Interace (UCI) protocol.</p>

							<h2>haskell-sudoku</h2>
                            <p>One of my early Haskell projects was a library for solving Sudoku grids, combined with an executable that runs a Sudoku HTTP server. It was an interesting challenge to apply search algorithms, which are typically implemented in imperarive languages, in a pure functional language like Haskell. I also learned how to use the Warp and WAI libraries to design the server API.</p>

                            <p>hoyo is a command-line utility I developed to make it easier to navigate around a Linux filesystem without having to remember lots of long directory locations. Using hoyo the user can "bookmark" directories (just like in a browser) and name them, making it very easy to come back to them later. I used <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative" target="_blank">optparse-applicative</a> for parsing the command-line arguments, and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tomland" target="_blank">tomland</a> for saving the bookmarks and config files.</p>

The player writes code in a custom imperative stack-based language to control the player character, who moves around a grid-based 2D map to avoid enemies and complete objectives.</p>
                            
                            <p>This was one of my first JavaScript projects, and my first time using HTML and CSS. I had to import some external libraries for the code editor, the map display, and manipulating the clipboard. A particular challenge with this project was persisting state across levels and user sessions, and keeping track of which language constructs the user had unlocked. I especially enjoyed designing and implementing my own small programming language, and I'm really happy with how the game ended up looking.</p>

							<p>Q25 is a mobile word puzzle game written for Android using React Native. The player is given 25 letter tiles with which to form as many words as possible. Longer words earn more points, and higher levels can be unlocked by reaching high enough scores.</p>

                            <p>This was my first medium-sized React project, and I had a lot of fun learning how to use the framework. I also learned the very important lesson of <i>"don't re-invent the wheel"</i>, and the game was much smoother and better-looking once I included open-source libraries like Reactive Native Paper, Redux, and Sentry.</p>

							<h2>About Me</h2>
                            <p>I was born in the UK and attended the University of Oxford, where I studied Mathematics for my bachelor's and Mathematical and Theoretical Physics for my master's degree.

                            After graduating I joined the Space Studies Program at the <a href="https://www.isunet.edu/" target="_blank">International Space University</a> in Strasbourg, France.

                            I then moved to Munich, Germany to start a job working as a contractor at the German Space Agency (DLR). I worked as a Systems Controller, monitoring and maintaining the ground systems that allow research bodies, universities and private companies to communicate with their experiments onboard the Columbus module of the ISS.</p>

                            <p>During this whole time I was teaching myself coding in my free time (and sometimes during slow shifts at the space agency!). Having learned some Python while I was at university and finding it quite intuitive, I started learning C++, which was a very different story! I also got into competitive programming on websites like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">HackerRank</a> and <a href="https://www.codingame.com/" target="_blank">CodinGame</a>. After I left the space agency I was surprised to find that I could turn this hobby into a career!</p>

                            <p>In the Spring of 2021 I started working as a scientififc researcher at the Technical University of Munich, where I still work today. I am working on the <a href="https://cilocharging.de/" target="_blank">CiLoCharging</a> project, using agent-based simulation to study the effects of delivery vehicle electrification in logistic fleets. I am also conducting my own research into digital privacy, specifically on Interdependent Privacy and game-theoretic approaches.</p>

                            <p>In my free time I like to work on my own coding projects (as you can tell by all the other stuff on this page!). I love exploring new languages, libraries and frameworks, especially ones that <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis#:~:text=A%20language%20that%20doesn%27t%20affect%20the%20way%20you%20think%20about%20programming%2C%20is%20not%20worth%20knowing." target="_blank">change the way I think about programming</a>. One day I would love to design my own programming language or OS. I also enjoy reading, watching films and TV, and travelling.</p>
