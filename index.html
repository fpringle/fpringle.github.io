							<h1>Frederick Pringle</h1>
							<p class="major">I am a passionate, hard-working, self-taught programmer and technology enthusiast, with a Master's degree in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics from the University of Oxford. I try to bring focus, dedication and intelligence to everything I do. Currently employed as a scientific researcher, I am looking for opportunities in the technology, software, research and related industries. I am skilled in several programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Haskell and Javascript; and have some experience in Ruby, TypeScript, and Rust. I believe I can be a valuable addition to any development or research team, and look forward to any opportunity to expand my skillset.</p>
							<p class="major">Below you can find some samples of coding projects I have worked on in my free time, organised by language. You can also jump to the <a href="#aboutme">About Me</a> section or <a href="#contact">send me a message</a>.</p>

                                        <p>I have the most professional experience in C++. It's what I use at work on a day-to-day basis, and is one of the languages I feel most comfortable in.</p>

                                        <h3>Python</h3>
                                        <p>Like many developers today, the first language I learned was Python. It's my go-to language for scripting, and offers the fastest time-to-MVP for concept testing.</p>

                                        <h3>Haskell</h3>
                                        <p>As a mathematician, I have a soft spot for Haskell and the functional programming paradigm. It's the most beautiful language I've worked with, and has changed the way I think about programming.</p>

                                        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                                        <p>I've played around with JavaScript as a hobbyist, and built several small games, websites and mobile apps to increase my proficiency.</p>

							<h2>Cybotify</h2>
                            <p>Cybotify is an ongoing collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/amschel-de-r" target="_blank">a friend</a> with the goal of increasing our proficiency in database management, machine learning, API development, and website design. The website uses Spotify's public "audio features" API to analyze user's playlists, categorising them according to themes such as accousticness, energy, key and tempo. In the future, the end goal of the project is to use machine learning to identify poorly-organised playlists, suggest alternate grouping of songs into playlist, and recommend new songs for playlists.</p>

                            <p>New competencies I learned from this project:</p>

                            <h3>API development</h3>
                            <p>The backend of the website uses Django for handling HTTP requests, authentication, and connecting to the Spotify API. Having never designed this kind of website before, I had to learn a lot about API design, HTTP routes and JSON encoding/decoding.</p>

                            <h3>Relational databases</h3>
                            <p>I used Django's built-in DBMS to manage user information, playlists, and track features, using PostgreSQL for the database backend. I gained a lot of knowledge of relational databses and query languages like SQL.</p>

                            <h3>Multi-dimensional data visualisation</h3>
                            <p>This project presented the challenge of explaining complicated multi-dimensional analysis to the user in an easily-digestable way. To visualise the feature analysis of user tracks and playlists, after some research I decided to use a "Spider plot" using PlotlyJS.</p>

                            <h2>Stacked</h2>
                            <p>Stacked is a browser-based game written in JavaScript. Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/AlexNisnevich/untrusted" target="_blank">Untrusted</a>, the player writes code in a custom imperative stack-based language to control the player character, who moves around a grid-based 2D map to avoid enemies and complete objectives.</p>
                            
                            <p>This was one of my first JavaScript projects, and my first time using HTML and CSS. I had to import some external libraries for the code editor, the map display, and manipulating the clipboard. A particular challenge with this project was persisting state across levels and user sessions, and keeping track of which language constructs the user had unlocked. I especially enjoyed designing and implementing my own small programming language, and I'm really happy with how the game ended up looking.</p>

                            <h2>Q25</h2>
							<p>Q25 is a mobile word puzzle game written for Android using React Native. The player is given 25 letter tiles with which to form as many words as possible. Longer words earn more points, and higher levels can be unlocked by reaching high enough scores.</p>

                            <p>This was my first medium-sized React project, and I had a lot of fun learning how to use the framework. I also learned the very important lesson of <i>"don't re-invent the wheel"</i>, and the game was much smoother and better-looking once I included open-source libraries like Reactive Native Paper, Redux, and Sentry.</p>

                            <p>Q25 is available on the Google Play Store, and can be downloaded below.</p>
